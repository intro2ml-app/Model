The course helps students to operate on a relational \ndatabase consistently using transactions. Students are also introduced concurrency control \ntechniques used in a RDBMS for ensuring correctness and effectiveness in an information \nsystem. Students could understand techniques used for database recovering from failures in a \nDBMS. Students could also apply security mechanisms provided by a DBMS. In addition, they \ncould understand how data is stored and retrieved on storage devices. Students are also \nintroduc ed the query processing algorithms and query optimization methods.  In particular, \nstudents are guided to work in group on exercices or course projects. Students are also \ninstructed to perform reading comprehension skills and writing simple reports in Engl ish. \n Mục tiêu của học phần  \nSau khoá học, sinh viên có khả năng:  \n− Work independently or in group to apply principles of RDBMSs  \n− Perform the reading comprehension skills, present and write simple reports in English  \n− Use the functions of a RDBMS, analysis and design to solve real -world information \nsystems  \n− Describe the general architecture of a DBMS   \n 148 − Operate on a relational database consistently using transaction processing concepts and \ntheory  \n− Use concurrency control techniques provided by DBMSs  \n− Describe the techniques used in DBMSs for database recovery from failures  \n− Apply security mechanisms provided by DBMSs in real -world applications  \n− Comprehend the way data is stored or retrieved on storage devices  \n− Comprehend the query processing algorithms and query optimization methods  \n− Apply functions provided by SQL Server together with a programming language in \nreal-world information systems  \n Nội dung học phần   \n− Introduction to DBMSs  \n− CTransaction  \n− Concepts and theory about concurrency control  \n− Two-phase locking techniques for concurrency control  \n− Deadlock Prevention  \n− Isolation levels and Lock modes  \n− Concurrency control based on timestamp ordering  \n− Validation concurrency control techniques  \n− Database recovery techniques  \n− Database security and authori zation  \n− Data storage and indexing structures for files  \n− Algorithms for query processing and optimization  \n Tài nguyên học phần  \nGiáo trình  \n− Elmasri & Navathe, Fundamentals of database systems, Pearson Education Inc., 7th \nedition, 2017.  \n− H.
